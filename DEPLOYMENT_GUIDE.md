# Amazon Clone - Deployment Guide for Vercel

## ðŸš€ Quick Deploy to Vercel

This Amazon clone with ML-powered product recommendations can be easily deployed to Vercel. Follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
- Vercel account (free tier available)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code
1. Ensure your code is in a Git repository
2. The frontend code should be in the `/frontend` directory
3. Make sure `package.json` is in the frontend directory

### Step 2: Configure for Vercel
Create a `vercel.json` file in the root directory:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "frontend/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "build"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/static/(.*)",
      "dest": "/frontend/build/static/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/frontend/build/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "Import Project"
3. Connect your Git repository
4. Set the build settings:
   - **Framework Preset**: Create React App
   - **Root Directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build Command**: `yarn build`
   - **Output Directory**: `build`

### Step 4: Deploy via Vercel CLI (Alternative)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Yes
# - Which scope? (Your username/team)
# - Link to existing project? No
# - Project name: amazon-clone
# - Directory: ./
# - Override settings? No
```

### Step 5: Environment Variables (if needed)
If you add backend functionality later, you can set environment variables in Vercel:
1. Go to your project dashboard on Vercel
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add your variables (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_URL`)
