# üöÄ Complete Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying your Amazon Clone with ML recommendations to Vercel step-by-step.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- ‚úÖ Your code pushed to GitHub repository
- ‚úÖ A Vercel account (free tier is sufficient)
- ‚úÖ Node.js 18+ installed locally

## üåê Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

1. **Initialize Git (if not already done)**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Amazon clone with ML recommendations"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it: `amazon-clone-ml`
   - Make it public (for free deployment)
   - Don't initialize with README (since you already have one)

3. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/amazon-clone-ml.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Connect to Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel**
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Sign Up" or "Login"
   - Choose "Continue with GitHub"

2. **Import Your Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Find your `amazon-clone-ml` repository
   - Click "Import"

### Step 3: Configure Build Settings

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: These settings are crucial for successful deployment**

When you see the configuration screen, set these EXACT values:

#### Framework Preset
```
‚úÖ SELECT: Create React App
```
*Don't select "Other" - specifically choose "Create React App"*

#### Root Directory
```
‚úÖ ENTER: frontend
```
*This tells Vercel your React app is in the frontend folder*

#### Build Settings (Configure Project)
Click "Build and Output Settings" to expand:

**Build Command:**
```
‚úÖ ENTER: yarn build
```
*or `npm run build` if you prefer npm*

**Output Directory:**
```
‚úÖ ENTER: build
```
*This is where Create React App puts the built files*

**Install Command:**
```
‚úÖ ENTER: yarn install
```
*or `npm install` if you prefer npm*

#### Environment Variables
```
‚ùå LEAVE EMPTY for now
```
*This is a frontend-only app, so no environment variables needed*

### Step 4: Deploy!

1. **Click "Deploy"**
   - Vercel will start building your project
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete
   - You'll see a success screen with your live URL

2. **Your Site is Live! üéâ**
   - URL format: `https://amazon-clone-ml-YOUR_USERNAME.vercel.app`
   - Click the URL to view your deployed Amazon clone

### Step 5: Test Your Deployment

Visit your deployed site and test:
- ‚úÖ Homepage loads with products
- ‚úÖ Click on a product to see details
- ‚úÖ **Scroll down on product page to see ML recommendations**
- ‚úÖ Add items to cart
- ‚úÖ Search functionality works
- ‚úÖ Navigation between pages works

## üõ†Ô∏è Method 2: Vercel CLI (Alternative)

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

### Step 2: Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```
*Follow the prompts to authenticate*

### Step 3: Deploy from Frontend Directory
```bash
cd frontend
vercel
```

### Step 4: Answer the Prompts
```bash
? Set up and deploy "~/your-path/frontend"? [Y/n] Y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? [Select your username]
? Link to existing project? [y/N] N
? What's your project's name? amazon-clone-ml
? In which directory is your code located? ./
? Want to modify these settings? [y/N] N
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Build Fails - "Command not found: yarn"
**Solution:**
Change Install Command to:
```
npm install
```
And Build Command to:
```
npm run build
```

### Issue 2: 404 on Page Refresh
**Solution:**
The `vercel.json` file should handle this. Make sure it's in your root directory with:
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/frontend/build/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Issue 3: Images Not Loading
**Solution:**
Check that all image URLs in `components.js` are publicly accessible HTTPS URLs.

### Issue 4: Blank Page on Deployment
**Solutions:**
1. Check the root directory is set to `frontend`
2. Verify build command is correct
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
